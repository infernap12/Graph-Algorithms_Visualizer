# Graph-Algorithms Visualizer

[Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/projects/207)

---

Learn how to draw graphs, create vertices and edges, connect them, handle events, and learn different algorithms
in-depth. Apart from that, learn how to make your application extensible to support more and more algorithms in the
future.

## Future Objectives

- Actually add visuals
- Implement Memento pattern
- Refactor search algorithm architecture to reflect open/close principle better
- Mouse dragging nodes "Move" tool
- Change vertex ID's/ edge weights "edit/rename" tool
    - Enforce single use of vertex ID
- Absorb vertex, taking in all edges from second vertex "Merge" tool
    - Take into account repaint, changing x, y coordinates
